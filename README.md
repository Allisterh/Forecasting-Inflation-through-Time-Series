# Forecasting-Inflation-through-Time-Series

In this project, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data of 100 countries in taken from the World Bank and ARIMA modelling is done to predict CPI (which is a measure of Inflation) for the future. Further, data of macro-economic variables of India such as GDP, Money supply and Consumption is taken to forecast Indiaâ€™s CPI using the ARIMAX and VAR models. Then, a comparison among the three different models is done to find which model predicts the CPI of India with the most accuracy.
